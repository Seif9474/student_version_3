              specializations: A - Computer Science The field of computer
              science focuses on the study of algorithms, data structures,
              various programming languages, and scientific computers. Some
              fields can also be studied, such as: Artificial intelligence,
              computer graphics, databases and networks. The strength of a
              computer science graduate lies in his ability to solve problems
              related to computer efficiency and the general performance of
              computer applications from the perspective of the computer.
              Graduates studying this major can work in many fields such as:
              Software engineering, financial calculations, modeling, game
              design, computer graphics. Robotics, artificial intelligence,
              computer hardware development, motion graphics. Biotechnology as
